* Make error messages vim-friendly (special flag).

* Better command-line parameter names and parsing:
  - Don't silently ignore unsupported options.
  - At least -h for help.

* Add more useful asserts:
  - assert_string_empty()

* Remember test name for asserts and error messages so nested functions don't
  mess up the output.
